  <p> Elbow Grease is dedicate to <span>hard work</span> and independent thinking. Our goal is to document the lengths people go to for their work, their <span>struggles</span> and their joys.</p>
  <p> Work has an innate value the goes beyond the quest for cash, and we believe stories of people who are brave enough to do somthing they love, to make a real difference, or maybe just to make ends meet, are worth sharing.</p>
